Server Name

You need to have the Novell Client for server functionality and Lotus Notes 4.6/R5 for Notes functionality. Pretty easy to use.(I hope) You Add your server to list of servers. Double click on the name of your server when it pops into the list and Wa! La! Information at your finger tips. Please vote

Uptime, CPU, Graphical Utilization

A bug. When you pull your server stats for the first time, The critical stats don't show. However, from that point on the critical stats will show up. I know it is there but haven't had time to track down the culprit.
