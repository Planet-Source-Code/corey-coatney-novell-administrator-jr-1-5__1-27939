'    Desc: Sample code which demonstrates how to use DLL function
'          calls in VB when getting server`s up time.
'          This code uses NWGetCPUInfo() function call which is available
'          on 4.x and 5.x servers only !
'          User should be already authenticated on given server
'          before running this program.
'          Used DLL calls: NWCallsInit(), NWCCOpenConnByName(), NWGetCPUInfo(),
'          NWCCCloseConn()
